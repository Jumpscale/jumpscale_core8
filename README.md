JumpScale is a cloud automation product and a branch from what used to be Pylabs. About 7 years ago Pylabs was the basis of a cloud automation product which was acquired by SUN Microsystems from a company called Q-Layer. In the mean time we are 4 versions further and we have rebranded it to JumpScale.

Please check our [GitBook](https://gig.gitbooks.io/jumpscale-core8/content/) for a full documentation (always shows the master)
