# SALs

SALs are system abstraction layers. They provide a unified interface to system operations. You can use the different available SALs to create powerful scripts that can monitor and manage your services.

@todo: Provide simple example of how to use SALS, just to introduce the concept

For a detailed discussion of SALs go to the [SALs documentation](../../SAL/SAL.md).
