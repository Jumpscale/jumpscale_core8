# Running JumpScale in a Sandbox

`js8` is a small command line tool that helps to install JumpScale 8 from scratch using the G8OS Virtual Filesystem.

## Installation of js8

js8 is a simple binary, written in Go.

You can download js8 and put the binary in your PATH location:

```shell
wget https://stor.jumpscale.org/storx/static/js8 -O /usr/local/bin/js8
chmod +x /usr/local/bin/js8
```

## Commands

Following commands are supported:

- **init** bootstraps your system and starts the FUSE layer
- **start** starts the FUSE layer
- **stop** stops the FUSE layer and then unmounts it
- **reload** reloads the metadata
- **update** updates the metadata file, then reloads the metadata

Below more details.

### init

`js8 init` will:

- Automatically install all packets required to run the AYS filesystem, including:

  - FUSE
  - tmux or another startup manager if you specify that explicitly; tmux is the default

- Download the AYF Filesystem binary and install it at `/usr/loca/bin/aysfs`

- Create a directory `/etc/ays/local/`
- Download the **js8_opt.flist** metadata file and put it at `/etc/ays/local/js8_opt.flist`
- Create a default configuration file at `/etc/ays/config.toml`

  - This default configuration uses <https://stor.jumpscale.org/storx/> as global store

- Add the ```-rw``` option to enable read/write support of the FUSE layer instead of read only

### start/stop

Starts and stops the AYS filesystem.

Three startup managers are supported, use one of the below options to indicate which one you want:

- **tmux** launches the AYS filesystem in a tmux session
- **systemd** install a service file in `/etc/systemd/system/aysfs.service` and uses **systemd** to start/stop/reload the AYS filesystem
- **default** runs the AYS filesystem directly; this will block on start

If you don't specify any startup manager, tmux is used.

### reload

This command asks the AYS filesystem to reload the metadata file. Use it if you add/edit/remove some metadata files and want them to be reflected in the FUSE layer.

### update

Downloads the lastest version of **JumpScale.flist** from https://stor.jumpscale.org/storx/static/js8_opt.flist, puts it at `/etc/ays/local/jumpscale.flist`, and then triggers a reload.
