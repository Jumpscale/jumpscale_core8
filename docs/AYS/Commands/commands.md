# AYS Commands

Since the number of command available in the AYS CLI is quite important, we organized them into groups.  
 - actor
 - blueprint
 - repo
 - run
 - service
 - template

Each groups has sub-commands. To inspect the available sub-commands of a groups do `ays group --help`.
E.g:
```shell
ays service --help
Usage: ays service [OPTIONS] COMMAND [ARGS]...

 Group of commands about services

Options:
 --help  Show this message and exit.

Commands:
 delete  Delete a service and all its children Be...
 list    The list command lists all service instances...
 show    show information about a service
 state   Print the state of the selected services.
```
