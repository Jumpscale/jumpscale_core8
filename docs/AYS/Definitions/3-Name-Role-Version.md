## AYS Service Name, Role & Version

Each AYS service has a name, a role and a version.

The *role* is the first part of name, and the version is added with ().

For example in `node.ssh (1.0)`:
- The name of the service is `node.ssh`, which in this case contains a `.` (dot) separating `node` as the role of the service and `ssh` the name of the instance
- The version is 1.0

Roles are used to define categories of AYS service recipes.
