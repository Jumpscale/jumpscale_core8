# AYS Service Name, Role & Version

Each AYS service has a name, a role and a version.

The _role_ is the first part of name, and the version is added with ().

For example in `node.ssh (1.0)`:

- The name of the service is `node.ssh`
- The role of the service is `node`. So a role is the first part of the name before the . (dot). Multiple service template can have the same role, but a name needs to be unique.
- The version is `1.0`

Roles are used to define categories of AYS service recipes.
