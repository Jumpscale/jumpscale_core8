# Walkthrough

Complete walkthrough (maybe rethink the name)
    (should take one example and go through the whole stack with it. Like bootcamp)
    - tools (tools, data) --> small examples that make development easier and faster
    - SALs
        j.sal.docker
    - Cuisine (it's a tool, but it adds remote management)
        cuisine.systemservices.weave
        cuisine.systemservices.docker ---> remote one
    - AtYourService
        do the same thing through bps
        do through j client
        do through cmd line
