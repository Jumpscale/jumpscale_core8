# Getting Your Feet Wet

JumpScale has an extensive library of tools which help you tackle any problem cloud computing can throw at you. The links below show you some of the most common ways to use the JumpScale framework, whether it's from the command line, or through our wrapper of IPython (the interactive Python shell) called **JShell**.

- [__Ways to Use JumpScale__](WaysToUseJS.md)

  - [JumpScale Interactive Shell](JShell.md)  
    **JShell** is the interactive Python shell with JumpScales **j** module and all its related submodules are preloaded.  

  - [JumpScale at the Command Line](JSAtCommandLine.md)  
    JumpScale provides many useful command line tools, tailored to work with the framework. The tools include wrappers around some of the services we use and other libs created by JumpScale.  

- [__JumpScale Core Components__](Components.md)

  - [System Abstraction Layers](SALs.md)  
    System Abstraction Layers or SALs as they are more commonly referred to, provide an Python abstraction layer to system tools. These SALs help streamline development, making it easier and much faster.  

  - [Cuisine](Cuisine.md)  
    Cuisine, based on the remote wrapper around **Paramiko**, a remote executor with useful commands. A JumpScale version was created adding much more abstraction, including service management, building and installation. Other useful commands were added to facilitate connecting at multiple level to remote machines.   

  - [AYS](AYS.md)  
    "At Your Service" or AYS, a service configuration and deployment tool built for cloud environments.
